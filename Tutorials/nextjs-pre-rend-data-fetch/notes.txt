Page Pre-Rendering
 - NextJS pre-renders all the data needed for the webapp/website on the server before being sent to the client side/browser.
 - Sends back all the JS code to the clientside too called Hydrate
    - For page interactions and dynamic content.
- initial page is pre-rendered.
    Two Forms of Pre-Rendering
    1) Static Generation - pre generated during build time Typically Recommended
        - Prepared during build time and cached by the server. Server will send the pre-built pages with JS hydration.
        - getStaticProps (Async function)
            - sub-code will not be seen on the clientside. 
            - the function is executed before the component function. (*assuming because it's the even loop)
    2) Server-side Rendering - pages are created after deployment when a request reaches the server.
        - getStaticProps is a NextJS async function that allows written server side code to run.
        - So within the encapsalation of the function, you can use node.js code.
Incremental Static Generation
    - Pre-generates a page and regenerates the page on a specific time interval. 
        - revalidate - key in the props object
        - notFound - key can be used if data fetched from server comes back as a 400 or any errors.
        - redirect - is another option that you can use if there are issues fetching data.

    - context vs router.query in getStaticProps
        - context: 
            - runs on the serverside, so data that is fetch does not require the browser to execute the data fetch.
            - The data is preloaded before the the page is sent to the browser
        - router.query
            - requires the browser the fetch the data before the data can be loaded.
            - Requires the HTTP Request for the page, and when the page is loaded, then an additional REST call to fetch the data.

getStaticPaths
 - Used for dynamic pages and it doesn't pre-generate the page by default.
 - If you have dynamic routes, using this async function should be the way to go.
 - helps create multiple pages.
    - keys:
        - fallback - stops other pages from being pre-rendered and only pages needed to be pre-rendered.
            - The other pages are only pre-generated when they're needed.
            - requires a fallback state
            - true allows you to pick specific pages to be pre-rendered and any other pages will be fetched and rendered.

getServerSideProps 
- Used to seperate pages that need server data such as cookies
    - is compiled with the code when deployed, but does not pre-generate a page
    - Only renders a page once ther request for the page has reached the server.

Head
 - Allows you to tags that are needed in head such as the title of the web app/site
