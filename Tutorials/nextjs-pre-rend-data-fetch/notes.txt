Page Pre-Rendering
 - NextJS pre-renders all the data needed for the webapp/website on the server before being sent to the client side/browser.
 - Sends back all the JS code to the clientside too called Hydrate
    - For page interactions and dynamic content.
- initial page is pre-rendered.
    Two Forms of Pre-Rendering
    1) Static Generation - pre generated during build time Typically Recommended
        - Prepared during build time and cached by the server. Server will send the pre-built pages with JS hydration.
        - getStaticProps (Async function)
            - sub-code will not be seen on the clientside. 
    2) Server-side Rendering - pages are created after deployment when a request reaches the server.
        - getStaticProps is a NextJS async function that allows written server side code to run.
        - So within the encapsalation of the function, you can use node.js code.
Incremental Static Generation
    - Pre-generates a page and regenerates the page on a specific time interval. 
        - revalidate key in the props object
        - notFound key can be used if data fetched from server comes back as a 400 or any errors.
        - redirect is another option that you can use if there are issues fetching data.
